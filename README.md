    ## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
    
We can construct an ATM program in Java to display ATM transactions. An automated teller machine (ATM) or cash machine (In British English) is an electronic telecommunications system that allows customers of banking firms to conduct financial transactions. The user must choose a choice from the options shown on the screen in the ATM application. For example, withdraw money, deposit money, check your balance, and exit the available options.
