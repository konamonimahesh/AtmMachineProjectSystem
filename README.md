Click on the Project.
go to default package.
Go to the project file .
Right Click on the project file
Click on the Run file to run the project file.
üéà Usage
Add notes about how to use the system.

Creating The Project i) Choose File > New Project ii) In Category Panel Select the java node and in the project pane, choose java application, Click Next. iii) Enter the Contact Editor and Enter the project name and specify the project location. iv) Click Finish.

Creating JFrames: To add a JFrame container:

    1)In the Projects window, right-click the ContactEditor node and choose New > JFrame Form. Alternatively, you can find a JFrame form by choosing New > Other >               Swing GUI Forms > JFrame Form.

    2)Enter ContactEditorUI as the Class Name.

    3)Enter my.contacteditor as the package.

    4)Click Finish.
When we added the JFrame container, the IDE opened the newly-created ContactEditorUI form in an Editor tab with a toolbar containing several buttons, as shown in the preceding illustration. The ContactEditor form opened in the GUI Builder‚Äôs Design view and three additional windows appeared automatically along the IDE‚Äôs edges, enabling you to navigate, organize, and edit GUI forms as you build them.

The GUI Builder‚Äôs various windows include:

Design area.
Source code
Pallet area
Navigator
If you click the Source button, the IDE displays the application‚Äôs Java source code in the Editor with sections of code that are automatically generated by the GUI Builder indicated by grey areas (they become blue when selected), called Guarded Blocks. Guarded blocks are protected areas that are not editable in Source view. You can only edit code appearing in the white areas of the Editor when in Source view. If you need to make changes to the code within a Guarded Block, clicking the Design button returns the IDE‚Äôs Editor to the GUI Builder where you can make the necessary adjustments to the form. When you save your changes, the IDE updates the file‚Äôs sources.

üöÄ Deployment
